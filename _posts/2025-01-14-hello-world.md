A goal of mine for 2025 is to start writing a technical blog, and this is the introductory post! My current target is one full blog post a month. This one doesn't count lol.

So far in January, I've been focused on getting [tree-sitter-crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang-tools/tree-sitter-crystal) ready for prime time. It's basically feature complete besides macros (full macro support is on the way <span class="emoji">ðŸ”®</span>).

I'm also catching up on my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/keidax/advent-of-code/tree/main/2024). I got sick at the end of December and trailed off the last few days, but I'm so close to the end, I still want to get that sweet <span class="emoji" style="color: #ffff66; background: #0f0f23;"><tt>50*</tt></span> dopamine hit!
